I maintain an [index of resources](https://github.com/pbiscaye/Teaching/blob/main/Data%20science%20resources%20index.pdf) related to data science for economists. It consists of a set of links to useful websites I have come across in recent years, organized by topic. The index currently has the following sections:
- Coding languages and tools: Python, R, Stata, Git, Excel, Latex, SurveyCTO 
- Analysis tools: Google Earth Engine, machine learning, web scraping, geospatial analysis, big data,  generative AI/LLMs, text analysis/NLP
- Causal inference: general causal inference, specific econometric methods
- Other resources: data, research resources, additional resources
