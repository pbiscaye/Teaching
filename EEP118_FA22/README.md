Note 1: This course generally follows the material in Wooldridge's *Introductory Econometrics*. Lecture materials rely heavily on original lecture slides produced by Professor Jeremy Magruder.
Note 2: Links to Jupyter Notebooks will likely not work for students outside of UC Berkeley. In the future I may post revised slides with working links to Jupyter Notebooks hosted outside of the UC Berkeley ecosystem.
